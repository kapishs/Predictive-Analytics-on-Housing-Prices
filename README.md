Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset
Predictive Analytics on Housing Prices
Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The project focuses on preprocessing data, handling outliers and missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling features, and applying advanced modeling techniques to achieve optimal performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing dataset, which contains 75 features describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, including physical characteristics, geographical locations, and other relevant factors that could influence housing prices.

Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebooks
3. Libraries
4. To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Data Loading
Make sure the dataset file (e.g., AmesHousing.csv) is placed in the same folder as your Jupyter Notebook. You can load the data using the following code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('AmesHousing.csv')
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps taken in this project include:

Handling Outliers: Identified and treated outliers in the dataset.
Dealing with Missing Data: Addressed missing values through imputation or removal.
Categorical Data Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalized or standardized numerical features to ensure consistent scale.
Model Building
The model building process involved the following steps:

Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Applied ElasticNetCV to find the best combination of L1 and L2 regularization.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used Grid Search to tune hyperparameters and achieve the best RMSE.
Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the primary performance metric. Cross-validation was also performed to ensure model robustness.

Results
RMSE: 20558.51
Mean Sale Price: 180815.54
The RMSE indicates that the model's predictions are, on average, off by approximately $20,558.51 from the actual sale prices.
Conclusion
The project successfully developed a predictive model for housing prices with reasonable accuracy. While the RMSE is acceptable, there are opportunities for further improvement in the model's performance.

Future Work
Future work may include:

Exploring additional feature engineering techniques.
Implementing different regression algorithms for comparison.
Experimenting with ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy.
