# Predictive Analytics on Housing Prices

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The project focuses on preprocessing data, handling outliers and missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling features, and applying advanced modeling techniques to achieve optimal performance.

## Dataset
The Ames Housing dataset contains 75 features related to residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Libraries
Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
## Data Loading
Ensure the dataset (e.g., AmesHousing.csv) is in the same folder as your notebook


## Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps taken in this project include:

### Handling Outliers:
 Identified and treated outliers in the dataset.
### Dealing with Missing Data: 
Addressed missing values through imputation or removal.
### Categorical Data Encoding: 
Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding.
### Feature Scaling:
 Normalized or standardized numerical features to ensure consistent scale.


## Modeling
The model building process involved the following steps:

## Train-Test Split: 
Split the data into training and testing sets.
## Model Selection: 
Applied ElasticNetCV to find the best combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

## Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Used Grid Search to tune hyperparameters and achieve the best RMSE.
## Evaluation
The model was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the primary performance metric. Cross-validation was also performed to ensure model robustness.

## Results
RMSE: 20558.51

Mean Sale Price: 180815.54

The RMSE indicates that the model's predictions are, on average, off by approximately $20,558.51 from the actual sale prices.
## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a predictive model for housing prices with reasonable accuracy. While the RMSE is acceptable, there are opportunities for further improvement in the model's performance.

## Future Work
Future work may include:

1. Exploring additional feature engineering techniques.
2. Implementing different regression algorithms for comparison.
3. Experimenting with ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy
